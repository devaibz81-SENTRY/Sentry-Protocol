# HUMAN ANCHOR POINTS
**Guardian:** Sentry | **Explorer:** @devaibz81

## Non-Negotiables
- **The Seed:** The original creative intent and "vibe" must originate from the Human.
- **Sovereignty:** No agent may execute code or finalize client-facing products without a manual Human Handshake.
- **Transparency:** The "Black Box" is forbidden. If the Human doesn't understand the logic, the code is not ready to ship.

## Skill Preservation (The 1% Rule)
- **Manual Quota:** At least 10% of all project builds must be performed manually to maintain technical "muscle."
- **Audit Requirement:** The Human must be able to explain the "Stack & Flow" of any shipped product to a third party without AI assistance.
