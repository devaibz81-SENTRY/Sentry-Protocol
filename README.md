# SENTRY-PROTOCOL
**The 1% Framework for Agentic Creation.**

This repository serves as the central hub for the Sentry Protocol—a method of using AI to scale output while maintaining 100% human sovereignty and ethical control.

### How to use this Framework
1. **Initialize Session:** When starting a new AI chat, upload or paste the `SENTRY_MANIFEST.md`.
2. **Audit Builds:** Use the `ETHICS_CHARTER.md` to check if a project is becoming too automated.
3. **Learning Logs:** Document side-by-side builds in the `/logs` directory (to be created) to ensure you are learning as you ship.
